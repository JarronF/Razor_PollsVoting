# Razor_PollsVoting
Proof of concept poll / voting project

Create polls via the Admin page.

Each poll has an expiry date.

Each poll can have multiple choices. 

When a user visits the page they must be allowed to vote in the provided poll. 

Once they have voted their IP address is logged and they are not allowed to vote again.

If they re-enter the polls page after already voting they should be shown the results so far.

Each choice should indicate how many users have voted for it and the percentage of votes for each choice.

The user should be informed whenhe entered his vote on that poll, and which vote he selected.
